		<h1>The Research Project</h1>
	
		<p>As I did an interview to one of my friends who named Shiwei Yin, a graduate student at Michigan State University at the Apartment of Business, told me some basic knowledge about advertisements. Advertising helps the suppliers to promote the sales of their products and services, helps the consumers to get the necessary information about the products and services they want, and promote consumption of products and service. There are many media for advertising. The most basic medium is the newspaper, the advertisement of which are classified clearly and in detail, easy for reader to look for the information they need according to the classification. The newspaper advertising cause very little upset for the readers who do not want to read advertisement. Advertisement in newspaper are practical and civilized. Advertisement in magazines are most specifically aimed. For instance, advertisements in fashion magazines are for fashionable women consumers, the targets of the advertisements in sports magazines are athletes and sports activists. Advertisement on radio and TV are more vivid and impressive, but not as specific and easy to find as those on newspaper and magazines. Nowadays, the advertisements on radio and TV last too long and affect the normal listening and watching of the audience. That’s a disrespect of the audiences and caused widespread antipathy. In some countries, TV and Radio station are state-run and do not allowed adverting. However, some businessmen dial others’ private phones at random to promote products or service, affect others’ private life. Such businessmen do not respect others and damage their own image which will produce the opposite results.

		<p>Our third assignment was to write a formal research report.  In class, Dr. Daniels gave us a Library Activity Exercise to help us to differentiate between general (popular) writing and scholarly (formal research) writing.  One property of scholarly writing is its audience. Materials in a pop ular article, such as an article in a magazine, possibly can be understood by most readers, regardless of their professional background or prior knowledge. However, unlike a popular article, an academic article is written by scholars to present their ideas and understanding to people in their field.  The author generally assumes that his or her audience already shares a lot of background knowledge from within their academic discipline. It is possible for an academic article to be full of jargon and complicated mathematical expressions without detailed introduction of either.  In addition, in order to share ideas with peers, the author needs to publish their article. A publication should follow the academic style/format strictly.
In the third assignment, the most important thing was to understand a scholarly article we selected and read, and to then summarize the article’s content while following APA or MLA standards.  We also read an article from a ‘trade publication’ devoted to the field for which our scholarly article was written.  We used information in the trade publication article to give the reader a sense of what it would be like to work in the field for which our scholarly was written.  The article was to be selected from our likely future discipline, an excellent idea as the assignment thus provided undergraduates with a chance to learn more about their future discipline.  We also conducted two interviews – one with a person teaching courses in our prospective future discipline, the other with a person who is working in a field close to that discipline.  The interviews gave me a broad set of facts and opinions about my chosen discipline, wh ich helped me to select an academic article to write about from the several articles I had initially selected and read.
Although at MSU a formal research paper is not required for most undergraduate courses, practicing and understanding how to write a scholarly article is very important. Most undergraduate programs require students to, before graduating, complete a research course within their major academic discipline. For example, every economics major needs to complete EC499, Senior Seminar for Economics Majors, a course in which students present research projects on one economics topics. It is particularly important for students who plan to pursue a Masters degree, or even a Ph.D. to learn writing skills.

		<p>“At the root of a well-run business is a core of leaders who not only know how to communicate efficiently among each other, but also among those below them. Moreover, this core of individuals also know how to help improve the communication ability and efficiency of those below them, you know mentor them in a positive way every day.” (Dietz). The importance of communication in the business world is fairly well understood standard. However, in marketing the importance to be able to communicate in a clear and concise manner is what separates the elite and the average. Whether it is to be a market researcher, a salesperson, or upper management, communicating successfully or the lack of communication will make or break you. In almost every definition of the word, marketing is the ability to communicate the value of a product to consumers. However, at each level of marketing the type of communication skills needed vary.  Expanding on this, market researchers require the skills to be able to think on their feet and provide fact filled, sound answers to the many questions consumers may come up with. On top of this, they must also be able to clearly describe who, why, and what they are studying in order to attract as many customers to partake in surveys as they can. Aside from this, salespeople need to be able to perform all the same communication skills as a researcher but then must add to it as well. Sales people need to have the skills to communicate to a consumer in a personable manner while also convincing the customer of the value of products they are attempting to sell. At the top, higher management persons must be able construe all of these abilities and supplement them even more-so than those prior. In higher management, one must be able to communicate to any and all persons interested in a product and answer any and all questions fully and factually.  They must also be able to successfully provide consumers with a sense of value to their product. However in higher management, there is also a need to be able to control and motivate those below you in order to produce quick and high quality reports as well as sales numbers. Moreover, depending on the level of higher management, an individual must also be able to understand how to create and communicate value of a product through advertisements and other commercial means. Similarly to almost all professions in this day and age, marketing has a number of different forms of technology used on a day to day basis.</p>
		<p>The majority of technology required to understand for marketing purposes is now beginning to be taught as early as middle school. This skill set for this type of technology includes basic computer skills, an understanding of the Microsoft Word Office Suite, and the ability to troubleshoot most problems that may occur on a computer. However, for those in market research a vast knowledge of Microsoft Excel is needed in order to create accurate charts and sort vast amounts of data quickly and accurately. However, just as those in higher management must be able to conduct themselves in all forms as those below them, so must they be able to perform the same skill sets in technology. On top of these skill sets, it is not necessary but can be very beneficial to know the inner workings of programs such as Adobe Photoshop and video editing in order to aid in the creation of well thought-out, well executed advertisements. These advertisements must be complex and interesting enough to catch the attention of the target audience, which is provided by the information gathered by those in market research, as well as simplistic enough to quickly communicate and produce a value for the product without being confusing to the consumer. It is in the technological area of marketing where all prior skills culminate to allow products to be shared with target markets in a way that pushes your product to the top allowing for less business risk when distributing your product due to it being on the forefront of consumers’ minds over competing products.

		<p>The writing style in the paper is formal, and there is no reference to the first person in the authors writing. This is because all formal writing should be objective. Farrel and Shapiro do not use the passive tense in writing the report since it is not suitable in formal writing. The presentation of facts and data in the paper is clear and concise without veering off topic. This is another quality of formal writing. Justification for using the upward pricing pressures in mergers is available in the discussion followed by proof (Farrell & Shapiro, 2000). This is an important aspect in report writing and every time one makes a premise, evidence should follow to support the premise.
Economics of Happiness: A Review of Literature and Applications by Nattavudh Powdthavee
 	
</p>
		<p>The above scholarly article is by a student in the Institute of Education, at the University of London. Many times, it is a requirement for a student to review different literature pertaining to an economic topic. This article provides a clear example of how to evaluate papers by different authors and make a clear conclusion. In this paper, the author studies utility functions as a way of determining individual preferences. Powdthavee further compares the different hypotheses about utility and rejects some of the facts as false (2007). For example, the utilitarian view of measurable cardinal utility, which furthers the idea of measuring the scales of utility and that the utility scales of different individuals are comparable, as unscientific. He then states that people may have the same income, buy an item at the same price and yet experience difference levels of satisfaction.</p>
		<p>When it comes to the issue about economy, the first word we will think of is business. Business plays a big role in the economy of our society today in creating job opportunities for the people hence reducing poverty. Business also boosts the society in economy and strong manufacturing and service sectors. Not only for the society, business takes part in our daily life as well. We need to know how business works to manage our personal finance. As a result, college students who major in business field need to acquire the knowledge of business. In our college, business is a broad discipline which consists of accounting, finance and budgeting, sales and marketing, financial reporting, taxation, and some other branches. There is an increasing number of students trying hard to attend the business college every year which results in the fierce competition among the students who are coming to higher education in business college. Nowadays, many students are confused about their majors as they become a participating member of an academic discipline. As a result, the purpose of my formal research report is to give the students who are new to the business field an introduction of specific application of business in our society and what are we going to learn among the courses.</p>
		<p>One important thing that have to be mentioned is the ways that literacy is used to creat and communicate knowledge in the business field. As is known to all, literacy is a fundamental skill that we have to master to deal with stuffs in our life, the same as in business field. There are three things that are vital important for business discipline. They are writing, reading, and researching. Writing is the most significant skill of communication. It is one of the most important transferable skills that workers possess. Reading is a significant part in business as well, especially in the leadership ability. Research is another important role in business decision. When we are dealing with the marketing and management, planning, evaluating and interpreting research are vital skills that we need to master. </p>
		<p>In conclusion, literacy plays a vital role in business field.</p>
