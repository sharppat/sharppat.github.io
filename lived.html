		<h1>The Lived Experience Project</h1>
		<p>This is the first project of the year! get your gears together because it's tiome to write. This first project is a personal story about a childhod toy that influenced you to pick the major you are persuing.It is relativly short and informal compared to the other papers you will eright this semseter but a good starter. Bellow are the views of each individual student as they give hints and their feelings about the project as a whole.</p>
		<p>The Lived Experience paper is a basic introductory to what is going to be done in a WRA class.  The topic of writing about a piece of technology that has influenced your choice of major should be relatively easy.  Students go to college to study a field that they are interested in.  Writing about a chosen major is a somewhat personal task.  Each person chooses their major based on something meaningful to them or something that they feel they are good at.  This paper is easier for people that have chosen a major that is based upon some sort of technology.  Writing my Lived Experience made me look at my major and ask myself if it is really what I want to do in life.</p>
		<p>The Lived Experiences project was an eye opener for me personally. The most stressful part was that I had never written a paper before that had a minimum word count. I had no idea how many words, on average, could fit on each page, so I just started writing as much as I could. One tip that I have would be to cover up the word count at the bottom of your screen, like I am currently doing. The more you look at it, the slower the paper seems to come along. There is a lot you will learn from the first assignment in terms of actual writing though. In this assignment, you are supposed to take a piece of technology that inspired you to choose your major, and describe it in tremendous detail. This is a very important skill to learn early on in your college writing career. Almost every paper is going to involve something that must be described in great detail. Descriptions are what give the reader an insight to what you are talking about. Without a description, a large portion of your paper may not make any sense to the reader. For example, my essay was about how car audio lead me to choose electrical engineering as my major. Most people have no idea about car audio, let alone all of the calculations that are involved as well as the electrical equipment itself. Without a proper description of everything I was talking about, the reader would not have understood the relevance of my topic to electrical engineering. For this assignment you also need to give a detailed description of your major so the audience has an idea of what goes on in that field. This can also be beneficial for you as a writer, because a lot of students choose a major without having any insight as to what is involved. It can really help you make your decision, or change your mind on your current decision.</p>
		<p>Lived Experiences Project was the very first project assigned in WRA 110. We were required to talk about our intended major and how a piece of technology helped to steer us towards that field. For this project I found it was much easier to write about when you are going into a more technical field. Then there are many options to choose from when relating a piece of technology. Also, you are supposed to include a turning point at some time in your life when you knew that you wanted to go into the field that you are going into. It is also very beneficial to have a piece of technology that is actually used in your career field and not just something that made you interested in it.  As long as you can relate your piece of technology and elaborate with great detail about how it made you interested in your specific career choice you can be successful on this assignment. </p>
		<p>
For a lived experience project, there are a few things that the writer should be aware of, these include personal aspects that explain why, when, where, and how they chose the career that the writer plans on pursuing. In order to do this, the writer must not be afraid to but feeling into the paper. It is a personal paper so it is supposed to be meaningful, not dull or extremely complex. They should also start the paper in a way that draws the reader in or makes them interested. Overall, the detail in this paper is the most important part because the paper is about you, no one else. You’re the one telling the story for everyone else to read.
</p>		<p>The lived literacy paper in WRA 110 stressed the idea of RAIDS. For the paper we were told to write a story about a piece of technology that made us want to pick our major. RAIDS came into play through the idea that we were revising the idea of why we chose our major, the arrangement was relating how our certain piece of technology made us pick our major, we were inventing this paper by using our past experiences, delivery was done by creating the webpage that presents our paper, and last the style was our own, which it made it more special and sentimental.
