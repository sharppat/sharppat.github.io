		<h1>The Blogs!</h1>
		<p>The final portion of the class is the final touch on each students website, the blogs. Each student writes 15 blog posts about anything and everything they want to write about. Throughout the course of the class the teacher does give prompts that you can write blog posts about but in hinds sight you can really write whatever you want in them. They're <strong>your blogs!</strong> most of these blogs are a paragraph or two
at most and rather easy given the open bounds of the assignment. Listed below are a few good examples of some blog posts from students within the class.</p>

<p>So, this is my blog for my writing class. Thus far if I've learned anything at all it would be that HTML is quite confusing and even when it is all set up for me to use and layed out to the fact that all I have to do is type in the blank space...I still feel lost. that being said, I am excited to learn HTML and unravel this somewhat complex lash of multivariable letters and symbols for thet fact that someday I hope to publish my research and this class will teach me to do that. I can say one thing, and I wouldn't say that it's as apparent as it seems to me but everyone in our class is lost. So lost that when we had to turn in our first rough draft that everyone came to the next class with a handful of questions that were not easily answered. We spent a majority of that class trying so desperatly to understand what HTML was and how that corralated with Github. Quite frankly, I still don't understand how to upload my paper to Github and I've been in class asking questions for the last three weeks. Hopefully we can get this all setled with before our next paper is due, I highly doubt that though. It is one of those situations where everyone is so lost that they don't know which question to ask first or even what question will even help them understand. To that I say, "welcome to my colege life". I have a calc prof who is fresh off the boat and can barely speak english. I have to ask questions multiple times to even get him to understand the perameter of the question that I asked the first time. I suppose from here on out I just bunker down and try and make it to a few office hours before I actually start getting behind.</p>
				<p>In other news, The ultimate frisbee team is wicked. Some of those guys are just crazy good at what they do, one is even on a profesional team! I didn't even know they had pro frisbee teams. Now I know they aren't being payed a few million dollars like 90% of all pro sports now a days, probably not even enough to sutain yourself muchless a family. It would still be awesome to play on a team of people who love frisbee so much that they are on a proffessional team! the level of dedication for that is just incredable. So far I have been to one tournament where we split up teams based off drawing from a hat. That went pretty well. It rained the first day so despite the cold and wetness of everything, people were diving for everything. It was a blast. My favorite part of the whole weekend was playing cards against humanity with everyone the night after the tournament. I haven't laughed so hard since I watched Gabrial Eglacias' new standup act. Overall a great weekend to play frisbee!</p>

			<h3> so you think you're not strong?</h3>			
<p>
Who says you’re not strong?
You get that from the minds of the wrong.
They say you are weak?
But it is really them who need the tweak.

So stand your ground
And don’t put on a frown,
Because in the end,
When you’ve reached the end of the band
You will be the one with the upper hand.

By-Patrick Sharp

As you set out on life’s road
unsure of the path you’ll go,
the most important thing you can do
is to always be true to “you”

Always remember who you are
in moments of struggle or fear.
Never forget or give up on
the hopes and dreams you hold dear

There will be setbacks and rejection
and moments of failure too,
but you must overcome any frustration
to achieve the potential of you.

Don’t forget to smile, or laugh,
or to live in the present;
no matter where life takes you
make every memory pleasant.

As you travel along your journey,
know that you’re never alone
and I’ll always be here for you
should you need the comfort of home.
